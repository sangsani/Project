## 3. Project Introduction
- The project name ”Find the cat snacks“ is an open source project created by characterizing Chung-Ang University‘s famous cat, Myeong-Sami(Tani). 
- In a similar form to the Google Dinosaur Game, a cat runs away from the chaser(butler) and ventures out in search of delicious snacks. It increases fun and immersion by further developing Google dinosaur games.
- We changed dinosaurs into cat characters so that students could feel more familiar and enjoyable, and added effectiveness obstacles such as bananas and dogs with certain coins deducted to plan for a higher quality and more difficult game. We have planned to experience meaningful games by adding cute stories, matching items (Ciao Churu: cat snacks, boosters, etc.) and sound effects.
- By new recreating existing games, students will be able to relieve stress and love cats through games. We expect a lot of interest and participation.
